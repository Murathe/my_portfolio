            <p>Murathe is my name, a dynamic developer who'll strive to give you all the most amazing creation. Having worked as a freelancer for five years, I exactly knows 
                what the market needs. Ranging from perfect SEO to web functionalities and the user experience, I have it all. For the last two years, I have majorly been building 
                on Ecommerce sites integration with the current models of payment to give my clients a smoothless experince with theor targeted consumers.
                </br>
                One key component of my work behaviour is on desk discussions with my clients in order to fully understand their needs. This also comes along with posing 
                several available designs and onto their approval, the development process kicks in immediately.
